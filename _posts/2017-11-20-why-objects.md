#### The world as it is today

Let us look at how the world exists without objects.

John and Kavita are two people who are writing some code.


John wants to calculate the area of a square. So he writes this fancy function.

```javascript
var areaOfSquare=function(square) {
  return square.length * square.length;
};

exports.areaOfSquare=areaOfSquare;
```
